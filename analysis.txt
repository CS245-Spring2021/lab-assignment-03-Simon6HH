Runtime Analysis:

TIME COMPLEXITY: The WiggleSort function has a time complexity of Big O(n) because the program is a linear time function
that has 1 line that executes once. Then lines within the for loop that could execute 8 times. Because of this the total
execution is 8(n) + 1 which simplifies to O(n).

SPACE COMPLEXITY: Since there are no constant terms and the space required does not increase with the size of n or nums.length. Using this 
we have 0 + 0N which is just a constant term 0 making the space complexity for this function Big O(1) constant.
