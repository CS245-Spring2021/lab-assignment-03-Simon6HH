Runtime Analysis:

TIME COMPLEXITY: The WiggleSort function has a time complexity of Big O(n) because the program is a linear time function
that has 1 line that executes once. Then lines within the for loop that could execute 8 times. Because of this the total
execution is 8(n) + 1 which simplifies to O(n).

SPACE COMPLEXITY: Since there are no constant terms in this function and we have a for loop that is fully dependent on N,
the space complexity is Big O(n). A linear space complexity with an allocated N sized array is fully dependent on the
array size which is all the space complexity that this functions uses.
